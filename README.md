## How it Works ?

SARIMA stands for Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. It is a time series forecasting method that extends the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to account for seasonality in the data. SARIMA models are particularly useful when dealing with time series data that exhibit a clear seasonal pattern or trend.
